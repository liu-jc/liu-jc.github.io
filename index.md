## About me
I am currently a Research Scientist at [Salesforce AI Research](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/). I obtained PhD in Computer  Science at School of Computing (SoC), National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by [Prof. Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). During my PhD, I also closely collaborated with [Prof. Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/), [Prof. Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/kawaguchi), and [Prof. Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/).
My research interests are graph neural networks, graph learning, and time series.

Prior to my PhD study, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Sichuan University, China.
